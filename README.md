Sales Behavior and Customer Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and customer behavior data to uncover key insights that can drive business growth and strategic decisions. By exploring sales trends across products, regions, demographics, and shipping preferences, this analysis provides actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement and revenue.

Key Questions Addressed
What are the top 5 best-selling products?

Which shipping methods are most preferred?

Do consumers pay less after applying discounts?

Which regions have the highest sales?

How do sales vary across demographics?

Which product categories show maximum sales?

Are there seasonal variations in sales?

Data Processing and Analysis
SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation directly from the sales database. SQL queries were crafted to:

Calculate median and average sales metrics.

Group sales by products, categories, demographics, and regions.

Handle missing data through conditional updates (e.g., replacing NULL review ratings with category medians).

Generate summary statistics and segment customers.

Python:

Data cleaning, manipulation, and advanced analysis performed with Pandas.

DataFrame operations to prepare datasets for visualization and reporting.

Integration with SQL via SQLAlchemy for seamless data pipeline.

Created visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn or exported clean data for Tableau.

Visualization
Tableau dashboards constructed to visualize:

Sales KPIs and top products.

Regional sales distributions.

Seasonal trend graphs.

Discount impact on average pricing.

Demographic segmentation (age, gender).

Shipping method preferences.

Category-wise sales performance.

Strategic Insights
Middle-aged males form the largest customer segment.

Jewelry, pants, and blouses dominate in sales.

Increasing store outlets in key states like Montana, California, and Idaho can boost revenue.

Seasonal sales peak in spring, suggesting marketing opportunities in off-peak months.

Discounts reduce average price paid but drive customer engagement.

Focus on customer surveys to align inventory with preferences.

Expand shipping options for greater flexibility and satisfaction.

This project showcases a combined SQL-Python-Tableau workflow that empowers data-driven decision-making in retail sales analysis.
